### 1. The Inventor & The Problem
In 1989, a scientist named **Tim Berners-Lee** was working at CERN (a huge research facility). He had a problem: scientists from all over the world couldn't easily share their research papers. Their computers spoke different "languages" and couldn't talk to each other easily.

To solve this, he invented the **World Wide Web (WWW)**.
*   He built the first **Server**.
*   He built the first **Browser**.
*   He built the first **Website** (in 1991).

His goal was to create a common language so any computer could share documents with any other computer.

### 2. Internet vs. World Wide Web (They are different!)
People often use these terms interchangeably, but they are not the same thing.

*   **The Internet (The Hardware):** This started way back in 1969 (originally called ARPANET). It is the physical infrastructure—the cables, wires, and computers connected together.
*   **The World Wide Web (The Software):** This is the system used *on top* of the internet to share information.

**The Analogy:**
Think of the **Internet** as a **Smartphone**.
Think of the **World Wide Web** as **Instagram**.
You need the phone (Internet) to use the app (Web), but the app is what makes the phone fun and useful for sharing things.

### 3. The Holy Trinity of the Web
When the web started, websites were just plain text. Over time, three main technologies evolved to make websites what they are today. Think of a website like a human body:

1.  **HTML (1991) - The Skeleton:**
    *   This was the first file type. It handles the **structure** and **content** (text and links).
    *   *Without it:* There is nothing on the page.
2.  **CSS (1995/1996) - The Skin & Clothing:**
    *   This handles the **style**. It adds colors, fonts, and layouts to make the skeleton look pretty.
    *   *Without it:* The web would look like a boring Word document from the 90s.
3.  **JavaScript (1995/1996) - The Muscles & Brain:**
    *   This handles the **interactivity**. It lets you click buttons, open pop-ups, or drag-and-drop items.
    *   *Without it:* The website would just sit there; it wouldn't *do* anything.

### 4. The "Browser Wars" & Mobile Phones
Once the web became popular, different companies built their own browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Edge).

**The Problem:**
Imagine giving a set of instructions to three different people. They might all interpret them slightly differently.
Browsers are the same. Sometimes, code that looks perfect in Google Chrome looks broken in Safari.

**The Challenge for Developers:**
As a developer, your job is to write code that:
1.  Works on **every browser** (Cross-browser compatibility).
2.  Looks good on **every screen size** (from giant desktop monitors to tiny iPhones).

### 5. Evolution of Tools (Then vs. Now)
The way we build websites has changed drastically since the early 2000s.

**The Old School (Early 2000s):**
*   **jQuery:** A tool used to make JavaScript easier to write (rarely used in new jobs today).
*   **LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP):** The old standard for back-end servers. Facebook was originally built on PHP, but it is less popular for new projects now.

**The New School (What you will learn):**
*   **React:** The modern way to build dynamic front-end applications (owned by Facebook).
*   **Node.js & Express:** The modern way to run servers using JavaScript.
*   **PostgreSQL & MongoDB:** Modern databases.

We have moved from simple documents to building full, powerful **Web Applications** that run in the browser.
